# Ruby Recursion Project: Fibonacci and Merge Sort

This repository contains solutions to two classic problems implemented using recursion in Ruby: Fibonacci sequence generation and Merge Sort algorithm.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. For example, the sequence begins with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.

### Methods Implemented

1. **Iterative Approach (`fibs`)**:
   - Implemented in the method `fibs`.
   - This method generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified length using iteration.

2. **Recursive Approach (`fibs_rec`)**:
   - Implemented in the method `fibs_rec`.
   - This method generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the specified length using recursion.

```

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It recursively divides the array into smaller sub-arrays until each sub-array contains a single element. It then merges these sub-arrays back together in sorted order.

### Method Implemented

- **Recursive Merge Sort (`merge_sort`)**:
  - Implemented in the method `merge_sort`.
  - This method sorts an array using the recursive merge sort algorithm.
